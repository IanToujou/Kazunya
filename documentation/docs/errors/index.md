# **Errors**

## **Introduction**

Error codes are used in a variety of situations when an error comes up. You can look up any error codes here and look for solutions to fix the problem.

!!! Tip
    Most errors are self-explanatory and simple to solve, just by reading the error message that comes together with the error code. A large amount of errors are related to command syntax or invalid inputs when using command arguments.

# **Command:** `/marry`

## **Description**

The marry command is used to marry other users on the server. You can only marry `3` users at a time. The marriage is valid on every server, that means that you don't have different married partners for different discord servers.

Being married does not grant any special abilities to the users at the moment. However, this might and will probably change in the future.

## **Syntax**

    /marry [@user]

- `@user` - The user you want to perform the action on.

## **Examples**

!!! Example
    Hildegard makes a proposal to another user, in this case, Albert.

        /marry @Albert

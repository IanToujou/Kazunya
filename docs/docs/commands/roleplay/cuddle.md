# Hug Command

Interact with another user by hugging them.

## Description

The /cuddle command will cuddle another user. Kazunya will return a matching GIF and ping the mentioned user.
GIFs are selected depending on the selected mode and personal settings.

Please note that the command can fail under certain circumstances, for example, if the other user does
not allow romantic cuddles, or if they disabled cuddles all together. More information, including how to manage
your preferences, can be found in the [Roleplay]() section.

## Usage

```asm
/cuddle <user> [<mode>]
```

Parameters:

- `user` | The user you want to cuddle.
- `mode` | The type of cuddle. Can be `casual`, `romantic`.

Additional settings, such as GIF appearance, whitelisting, etc. can be configured on the [Personal Dashboard]().

## Examples

```asm
# Give Kazunya tons of friendly cuddles!
/cuddle @Kazunya
```

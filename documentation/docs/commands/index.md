# All Commands

## **Introduction**

Commands are an essential part of Discord bots, and therefore also for Kazunya! Commands trigger most of the events and actions that Kazunya features. Below is a list of all the commands that Kazunya supports, including NSFW ones and admin-only commands.

### **Categories**

- 🟢 `PUBLIC` | These commands can be used by every person. Most commands are public and everyone can use them.
- 🟡 `RESTRICTED` | Restricted commands can only be accessed by people with specific server permissions, for example message deletion, reaction handling, etc.
- 🟠 `ADMIN` | Admin commands can only be used by server owners or by server admins. These commands include, but are not limited to, server settings and moderation settings.
- 🔴 `BOT ADMIN` | Bot-administrative commands can only be used by bot administrators or the owner of the Discord bot Kazunya. These commands can be executed by the bot admins no matter on what server they are on.

### **Additional Tags**

Some commands have additional tags that can define whether a command can be used in a specific channel or only in a specific situation.

- 🔞 `NSFW` | NSFW commands can only be used in NSFW channels. This is mandatory to avoid posting NSFW media in the wrong channels.
- 🌐 `GLOBAL` | These commands can also be used by people who are banned from using the bot. These commands normally include information and ban appeals.

# **Command:** `/partner`

## **Description**

The partner command is used to add other people as your relationship partner. A partner is like a boyfriend or a girlfriend. You can only have up to `5` partners at the same time.

In order to add a person as a partner, you need to be friends with them first. Being in a relationship with someone else allows you to marry that person, for roleplay purposes.
